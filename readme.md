# What is UHC?

**Summary**

Battle Royale Style Mode
Worldborder (zone/circle/storm whatever you want to call it) has a starting radius of 1250 blocks and shrinks to a radius of 5 over the course of 1 hour.
You will begin taking damage when outside of this area.

**Getting Started**

When the game starts players are spread randomly around the entire map in teams.
The gamemode works like survival minecraft, you start with nothing and must collect resources and put together armour and weapons.

**PVP**

PVP can happen whenever, you could get really unlucky and spawn 10 blocks away from another team (very very unlikely) but it is possible. 
This means you will always need to be on the lookout for enemy teams, however the majority of PVP is most likely to happen towards the end of the game
when players are actively hunting one another down in the smaller world border.

**Regeneration**

Natural regeneration is turned OFF. This means you can only heal using golden apples/regeneration potions etc.

**God Apples**

When you kill another player they will drop a player head. You can use this in place of the apple to craft a enchanted golden apple, this item is very powerful and will heal you to full HP.

**Fast Smelting**

Iron ore, gold ore and meat will smelt 10x faster in a furnace. This helps to speed up boring gameplay and allows players to focus on the more interesting aspects.

**Winning**

When you die you will be able to spectate your own team and cannot respawn.
The final team standing wins the game.
